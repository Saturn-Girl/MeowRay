#MeowRay


MeowRay is a paid and open 3D modeling software written in Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and x86 Assembly. It includes .exe and .dll files compiled from Assembly. The core interface and logic are built using web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), with low-level support from Python and Assembly.
